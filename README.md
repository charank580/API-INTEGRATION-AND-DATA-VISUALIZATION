##The Weather Dashboard is a Python-based application that fetches and visualizes real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. Using the requests library, the dashboard collects a 5-day weather forecast for a specified city, which is then processed into a structured format using pandas. The data is visualized through line and bar charts with matplotlib and seaborn, showing temperature trends, humidity variations, and daily average temperatures. Streamlit is used to create an interactive web-based dashboard that displays the data table and plots in a user-friendly interface, allowing users to explore weather patterns effectively. This project demonstrates practical API integration, data processing, and visualization skills in Python and can be executed locally or deployed online, making it a simple yet powerful tool for learning and showcasing real-world data analytics techniques.
